Together with two other students for the course Big Data Analytics at Copenhagen Bussiness School I analysed the role social media played for firms in the airline industry. The project not only deepened my understanding of the linkages between business intelligence and analytics but also gave me hands-on experience with big data. More specifically, we analysed this using both Auto dynamic lag models and panel data estimation with a fixed effect for entity and time. The data was retrieved from Social Data Analytics Tool and Bloomberg and the final panel had more than three million observations. The data pre-processing mostly concerned date entries and dealing with missing observations and large outliers. All data wrangling and statistical applications weredone in R but we complemented with data visualisation using Tableau.
