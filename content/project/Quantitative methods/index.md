Along with two other students, I was responsible for providing PC-based exercises and solutions for seminars. The main objective of the course is to provide students with the necessary statistical tools to conduct empirical analysis during their undergraduate and graduate study programs by introducing a range of statistical models and methods. 

The course was focused on various applications of basic regression models. Throughout the course focused on the qualitative and quantitative understanding of statistical models. That is, how to translate a qualitative research question into a quantitative model and make inferences. 

We used Stat for all data wrangling and statistical applications. The models covered include: 
- Multiple regressions
- Binary outcome (logit and probit)
- Maximum likelihood estimation 
- Panel regressions
