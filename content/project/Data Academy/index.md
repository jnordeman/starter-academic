I was nominated by the Director General in Economics to be part of the ECB Data Academy Working group to establish the first ECB Data Curriculum consisting of online courses, classroom training, and other learning initiatives. This Data Curriculum aimed at closing the knowledge gaps in the field of data science by providing modern learning opportunities and contribute to the ECBâ€™s data transformation. The curriculum included topics related to data processing, data visualisation, machine learning, and big data.
