When I was working in the Data Integration Team at the ECB, I held various exercise sessions for colleagues at the bank. These exercise sessions, so called open-hours, were tailored for central bankers and aimed to give a basic grounding in the use of modern data and programming tools. For the most part, the courses were given to colleagues who never had coded in R but were already familiar with basic coding concepts. The exercise sessions were recurring regularly which gave everyone the opportunity to refresh their knowledge from these sessions as they need it. The courses that I taught included:

- Data visualisation in R: introduction to ggplot2
- Data visualisation in R: advanced ggplot2
- Data wrangling in R: introduction to data.table
- Dashboards in R: introduction to shiny
